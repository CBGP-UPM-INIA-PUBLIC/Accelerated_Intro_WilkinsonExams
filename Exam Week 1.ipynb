    "# BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "I have retrieved the Locus Germplasm Phenotype file from The Arabidiosis Information Resource (TAIR - one of the primary _Arabidopsis_ databases globally) (https://www.arabidopsis.org/download/index-auto.jsp?dir=/download_files/Polymorphisms_and_Phenotypes ).  The file contains information about the phenotypes associated with certain _Arabodopsis_ mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file is in the current folder - called [Locus_Germplasm_Phenotype_20130122.txt](./Locus_Germplasm_Phenotype_20130122.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file format is \"tab-separated values\".  This means that each data field is separated by a \"tab\" character.  **There is one line at the beginning of the file -the \"header\" - that describes the type of data in each column.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first column is the \"Arabiodopsis Genome Initiative\" (AGI) Locus Code.  Locus Codes have a predictable structure\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first character is \"A\" or \"a\"\n",
    "* The second character is \"T\" or \"t\"\n",
    "* The third character is the chromosome number (between 1 and 5)\n",
    "* The fourth character is \"G\" or \"g\"\n",
    "* The remaining characters are a set of 5 digits (between 0 and 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Example:  At1G22934**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final column in the dataset is the PubMed ID for the published paper describing this phenotype.  PubMed IDs are all digits (0-9) but the length of the ID is unpredictable.\n"

    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* Copy this data file to your copy of the Exams Git ( https://github.com/YourUsername/WilkinsonExams )\n",

    "## Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a directory listing command that shows:\n",
    "* the ownership of the file\n",
    "* it's file-size, in Megabytes (i.e. human readable)\n",
    "* in words (in the text box), describe the _permissions_ on that file (read/write/execute) for users, groups, and \"anyone\"\n",

    "* Create a command that writes ONLY the data lines (i.e. excludes the header!) to a new file called \"Data_Only.csv\"\n",
    "* prove that your output file has the expected number of lines\n",

    "* Create a command that shows all of the lines that have a phenotype including the word \"root\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 7\n",

    "## Problem 9\n",
    "\n",
    "* _**Control experiment**_:  You would hypothesize that genes associated with roots **should be found on all chromosomes.**  Find a way (one or more commands) to test this hypothesis.  In this dataset, is the hypothesis true? \n",
    "\n",

    "## Problem 10\n",
    "\n",
    "* If your control experiment shows genes on every chromosome, then you can skip this question!  (you answered Problem 9 correctly!)\n",
    "\n",
    "*  If your control experiment shows genes only on one or two chromosomes, then you have to explain that... what could the problem be?  (I told you specifically to be careful about this problem!)\n",

    "## Problem 11\n",
